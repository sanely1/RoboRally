 ### Launch and play our version of "RoboRally
 For launching a game need to start a server, server can be used either from us or test server from the University. 

 To start the JAR File:

 To start the Server: 
 java -jar adrette-apparate-server.jar

 To start the Client:
 java -jar adrette-apparate-client.jar

 after launching Client user will get a Conncetion Window. It will ask for IP and Port.

 So an example of the IP and Port Combination options would be:
 
- Combination 1 = IP: sep21.dbs.ifi.lmu.de Port: 52018, 52019
- Combination 2 = IP: 127.0.0.1 Port: 3232

After user entered IP and Port, user can play a Game as normal User or as AI.

Thank you
- You need the libraries: the library of javafx version 16, gson version 2.8.7, json
